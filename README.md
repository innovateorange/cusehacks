# CuseHacks Github Page

This is the Github page for CuseHacks at https://innovateorange.github.io/cusehacks.

This was made from the MLH Hackathon Boilerplate found at https://github.com/MLH/mlh-hackathon-boilerplate.


## Understanding the repo

All the information is written in _config.yml. This is where the information can be changed that displays on the website.

Most of the structuring is done in _layouts/default.html, _includes/head.html, _includes/hero.html, and index.html. This is where the information from _config.yml is used. This is also where the way information is displayed on the website can be changed.

The css is in the css folder. This is where all the styles are.

Ignore the _site folder, you do not need to touch/change it. This is automatically compiled from all the other information.
