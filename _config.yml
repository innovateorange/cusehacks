# Frequently asked questions.
faq_message: >
    Have questions? You've come to the right place! Here are all our 
    <span style="color: #48bd96;">top questions.</span>
faq:
  - question: "What is a hackathon?"
    answer: >
      A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
      software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's
      [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl){:target="_blank"}.
      CuseHacks is not your typical hackathon. We encourage students with any level of experience to sign up.
  - question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: >
      Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free, and we will provide resources throughout the event.
  - question: "Who can participate?"
    answer: >
      All current college students are invited to participate.
  # - question: "Will there be travel reimbursement?"
  #   answer: >
  #     We can not ensure travel reimbursements right now, but it may be a possibility. Please email 
  #     innovateorange@syr.edu for more information.
  - question: "What if I don't have coding or hackathon experience?"
    answer: >
      Beginners are especially encouraged to come! You do not need previous hackathon/coding experience or a technology
      background. CuseHacks is meant to be a comfortable learning experience for everyone. Also, there will be workshops
      and mentors available throughout the event that can help you get started.
  - question: "How do teams work?"
    answer: >
      Each team can have up to as many members as you want. Typically teams run from 3-4 members. You can come 
      with your friends or you can form a team at the event. There will be team forming activities at the 
      beginning of the hackathon for anybody interested. You can also work alone if you want.
  # - question: "Is there a schedule?"
  #   answer: >
  #     The schedule is posted on the [CuseHacks 2020 Devpost](https://cusehacks2020.devpost.com/){:target="_blank"}. The Devpost is also where 
  #     submissions are posted.
  - question: "Will there be prizes for hacks?"
    answer: >
      Yes, there are many prizes we will be giving out! At the end of the 24 hours, there will be an expo where you 
      can demo your invention. Judges will be looking for the best inventions to fit the prize categories on 
      the Devpost.
  - question: "Where is the event?"
    answer: >
      CuseHacks is going VIRTUAL! Join us from wherever you are in the world. We'll be hosting it virtually on this website.
  - question: "Is there a code of conduct?"
    answer: >
      Yes there is. We enforce it very strongly. You can find it
      [here](https://static.mlh.io/docs/mlh-code-of-conduct.pdf){:target="_blank"}.
