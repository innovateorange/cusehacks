# Frequently asked questions.
faq:
  - question: "What is a hackathon?"
    answer: >
      A hackathon is an invention marathon. Students come together to build cool
      software & hardware hacks over 24-48 hours. It's
      [very beginner friendly](https://medium.com/@tfogo/hackathons-are-for-beginners-77a9c9c0e000#.cj21niskl){:target="_blank"}.
      CuseHacks is not your typical hackathon. We encourage students with any level of experience to sign up.
  - question: "How much does it cost?"
    answer: >
      Nothing. Attending a hackathon is free, and we will provide meals, snacks, and swag throughout the event.
  - question: "Who can participate?"
    answer: >
      All current college students are invited to participate. We will be capping attendance, so please register ASAP!

    answer: >
      We can not ensure travel reimbursements right now, but it may be a possibility. Please email 
      innovateorange@syr.edu for more information.
  - question: "What if I don't have coding or hackathon experience?"
    answer: >
      Beginners are especially encouraged to come! You do not need previous hackathon/coding experience or a technology
      background. CuseHacks is meant to be a comfortable learning experience for everyone. Also, there will be workshops
      and mentors available throughout the event that can help you get started.
  - question: "How do teams work?"
    answer: >
      Each team can have up to as many members as you want. Typically teams run from 3-4 members. You can come 
      with your friends or you can form a team at the event. There will be team forming activities at the 
      beginning of the hackathon for anybody interested. You can also work alone if you want.

      The schedule is posted on the [CuseHacks 2020 Devpost](https://cusehacks2020.devpost.com/){:target="_blank"}. The Devpost is also where 
      submissions are posted.
  - question: "Will there be prizes for inventions?"
    answer: >
      Yes, there are many prizes we will be giving out! At the end of the 24 hours, there will be an expo where you

      the Devpost.
